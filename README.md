# About

The idea of this project is develop a simulation of entities on a grid, which behave according to pre-defined needs and desires, following their senses to explore the world and interact with each other.

## Implemented thus far

- Grid
- Generic entities
- Smell generated by entities and diffusion logic
- Simple entity movement following any other entity by smell

## General TO-DOs

- Sound, light, their diffusion
- Motivations
- Types of sounds, smells and light
- Types of entities
- Entity movement patterns / pathfinding
- Entity interactions (fight or flight)
